# TagAWall

A cleaner refactoring of [Yung Jake's Yenerator Website](https://yenerator.com). Jake released the website following Kanye West's album release of "Ye". 

Jake's concept was both fantastic and popular, as it tied graphic design, programming, user interaction, and meme culture together. I wanted to do something similar, but replicating a tag. Postal stickers with added wildstyle are very popular in street culture, as they're both inexpensive and iconic. 

I originally attempted to refactor Jake's website itself, but became confused by dependency issues. Ended up building my own. Possible future modifications include font changes, background changes, and sizing adjustments.
